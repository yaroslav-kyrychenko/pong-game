# pong-game

A Python game built using the turtle library. 

This is my first attempt to build a game using the Python programming language. The turtle library was chosed due to several reasong: 
1) it's simple and user-friendly for beginners;
2) the documentation is understandable for the beginners;
3) it's a built-in Python library and does not require additional installation. 

The game was created on Python v3.7.4 on Windows using the VS Code editor.

Based on the YouTube tutorial by Christian Thompson (https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLlEgNdBJEO-kXk2PyBxhSmo84hsO3HAz2). However, a few modifications have been added.
